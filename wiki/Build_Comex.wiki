= Introduction =

This page lists methods to build Comex components on Linux and Windows os.

= Build on Linux =

== Build and install from tarballs ==

Can find tarballs in [http://code.google.com/p/comex-project/downloads/list Downloads area].

Dependencies:
 * mono devel package
 * log4net devel package
 * gtk-sharp2 devel package
 * glade-sharp2
 * qyoto devel package

To build and install can use:
{{{ 
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install (as root)
}}}

NOTE: _you need to build and install *comex-base* as first. Before build other tarballs need also to register dlls in mono GAC_
{{{
# gacutil -i /usr/lib/comex-base/comex-base.dll -package comex-base -gacdir /usr/lib/mono/gac
}}}

<br />


== Build from sources ==
Need to obtain sources using checkout instructions contained in [http://code.google.com/p/comex-project/source/checkout Source Tabs].

After can use [http://monodevelop.com/ MonoDevelop IDE] to build all solutions. Note that you need to change reference to comex-base and log4net in other projects (comex, comex-gtk, comex-qt) because default reference is in GAC.

== Build from sources ==
Need to obtain sources using checkout instructions contained in [http://code.google.com/p/comex-project/source/checkout Source Tabs].


After can use [http://sharpdevelop.net/opensource/sd/ SharpDevelop IDE] to build all solutions. Note that you need to change reference to comex-base and log4net in other projects (comex, comex-gtk) because default reference is in GAC.
